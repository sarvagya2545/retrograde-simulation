Work done till now:

1. Used pygame library which allows us to create games using pygame
2. Created planet objects (representation of a planet in code),
   The object stored:
    a. X and Y coordinate values
    b. mass, color and radius
    c. x and y components of its velocity
3. At every frame, from the previous positions of the planets, a gravitational force is calculated between every pair of planets and used to change the velocity of the planets, so the planets travel in an elliptical orbit, but the orbit is almost circular because 1 AU of distance is represented by 100 pixels only.
3. At every frame, the new position of the planet is reproduced.
4. The orbit is printed for the planets and then a line is drawn between the planets and the distance is calculated and is shown
